# K-Music; An audio player for KaiOS with playlist manager
## This Fork
This fork makes some slight changes to make the app more usable for me.

1. The sort-right button on the home screen takes you straight to the artist view with the search box focused, the menu button has been moved to the left.
2. From this artist view, you can use the soft right key to loop trough album>playlist>artist. Each time, the search box will be highlighted at start.
3. The background will remain a static colour, not updating to the album art.
4. Kaiads have been taken out.

I plan to add, remove and tweak more.

A massive thanks goes out to the original developer for putting in the larger part of the work, [arma7x](https://github.com/arma7x/kaimusic)
